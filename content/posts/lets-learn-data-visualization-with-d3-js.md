  FreeApril. In this video, I get into data visualization with D3.js

My goal with this video was to build out a scatterplot chart using D3.js and a dataset I found on Kaggle. I had no previous experience with D3.js so I think this was a great way of learning and getting starting with data viz! It was a great ride if you ask me.
