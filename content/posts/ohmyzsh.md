Tired of the good ol' boring looking terminal? Do you want to try something different and funky then you should definitely try Oh-my-zsh! As developers, we can't deny the fact that the Command line terminal is part of our existence._

_[Oh-My-Zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/) is an open source, community-driven framework for managing your ZSH configuration. It comes bundled with a ton of helpful functions, helpers, plugins, themes, and a few things that will make you shout._

__*Prerequisites*__
------

_* Disclaimer: Oh My Zsh works best on macOS and Linux._

+ Unix-like operating system (macOS or Linux)

+ Zsh should be installed (v4.3.9 or more recent). `sudo apt-get install zsh` If not pre-installed (zsh --version to confirm), curl or wget should be installed

+ git should be installed

__*Installation*__
----

_Via wget_

```

$ sh -c "$(wget https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh -O -)"

```

_Via curl_

```

$ sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"

```
Now we have zsh and oh-my-zsh installed next step is to go ahead with configuration.

**THEMES**
-----------

Oh-My-Zsh comes bundled with several [themes](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Themes) located in `~/.zshrc/themes` which can be enabled by adding the name of the theme in the ~/.zshrc file.

```bash
# nano ~/.zshrc
# This can be changed to whatever theme is preferred
ZSH_THEME="agnoster"
```

**PLUGINS**
-----------

Oh-my-zsh also includes a handful of [plugins](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Plugins) available to help make development faster and easier. One of my best is the fact that auto-completion works out of the box. You would not need to type a whole command just hitting tab helps by suggesting possible command related to your needs.

Another awesome thing to try is the [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)  This package provides syntax highlighting for the shell zsh. It enables highlighting of commands whilst they are typed at a zsh prompt into an interactive terminal. This helps in reviewing commands before running them, particularly in catching syntax errors.

__Tip ðŸ’¡__

_You can easily switch between bash and zsh by running this command_

```bash
# switching from zsh to bash
exec bash
```

```bash
# switching from bash to zsh
exec zsh
```

_There you go, I hope after reading this you switch from whatever shell you were using to zsh and also try out oh-my-zsh they are both awesome.ðŸš€_
