description: "Building accessible applications or websites is not the norm today. This is because the idea of accessibility is known to most developers, while in actual sense it is often neglected and not a common practice today in the world of web development."

I wrote an article on [Web Accessibility for Beginners](https://scotch.io/tutorials/web-accessibility-for-beginners) on [Scotch.io](https://scotch.io). This article explains what web accessibility is about, ways we can adopt accessibility as developers and tools we can leverage in building accessible application and websites.
