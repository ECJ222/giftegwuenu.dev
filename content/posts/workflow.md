_Nearly every developer works with different tools on a daily basis to help them achieve their goals or complete specific tasks. In this post, Iâ€™ll outline the tools I use for my day to day activities. First thing Iâ€™ll like to do is define a workflow._

## What is a Workflow?

_A workflow is a series of event or task that processes a set of data. Workflows occur across every kind of business and industry. They are the paths that describe how something goes from being a work in progress to complete or raw to processed. Here's an example I have a workflow for writing articles, I start by looking for ideas for a post, to creating an outline and then writing the actual content of the post to publishing all these are series of event to achieving a task._  
_As a developer, I tend to make use of certain tools that help speed up the process of completing a specific task. Even though a lot of these processes might be different for everyone I still feel the need to share this with you. In the end, no knowledge is lost right!_

## Tools I use to help speed up productivity

_This is going to be a broad list so Iâ€™ll try and split them into different categories, Iâ€™ll be highlighting the tools I use when coding, writing, and other tools I think you will find helpful in general._

### Coding Tools

#### GitKraken

![GitKraken hompage](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_E948749FFF9AABC92D46BF495805D213A4C4E2668CE3B0F9FAB1649B51E48A0F_1550393045469_Screen+Shot+2019-02-17+at+9.43.43+AM.png)

_I found out about this tool recently from a friend and I really love using it. Iâ€™m a big fan of using the command line over using GUI but this tool is so much different. GitKraken is a GitHub client application that works just like the command line you are already used to but with intuitive UI/UX that makes for a great experience when you using this over the command line._

#### Insomnia

![Insomnia app](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_E948749FFF9AABC92D46BF495805D213A4C4E2668CE3B0F9FAB1649B51E48A0F_1550393433785_Screen+Shot+2019-02-17+at+9.50.15+AM.png)


_This tool is another one I really like using. It is similar to Postman but also allows your query GraphQL endpoints which are cool right. Insomnia is a Powerful HTTP and GraphQL tool belt that is available on Mac, Linux and Windows platforms. Its features include GraphQL support, SVG and image previews, AWS authentication etc._

#### Visual Studio Code

![code homepage](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_E948749FFF9AABC92D46BF495805D213A4C4E2668CE3B0F9FAB1649B51E48A0F_1550393805099_Screen+Shot+2019-02-17+at+9.56.28+AM.png)

_[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a code editor that I really love using. I have been using for over a couple of years now and Iâ€™ve not found any reason to stop, with constant improvements and new features added regularly this is my goto choice for a code editor._

#### Dash

_Ever wanted to use GUI instead of the command line for Git. Then SourceTree is your best bet. I already mention GitKraken and they both do the same job I usually alternate between both apps occasionally. So Iâ€™ll say use what works best for you they are both great apps._
 
#### Postico
