Imagine my thoughts when I first saw the TailwindCSS Framework, in my head I already thought this was one of the usual frameworks like Bootstrap, Bulma, and Foundation, etc that I have tried using before and I took my eyes off it for a second. Until recently I decided to give it another look after I saw the recent release of v1 and to my greatest surprise, I fell in love with TailwindCSS at second sight. In this article, I’ll be introducing you to TailwindCSS and why I think it is a different ball game entirely with useful examples of cos. Let’s get right into it, shall we?

## Introduction

[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a utility first CSS framework for building custom user interface designs. Tailwind CSS is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs without any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override.

## Why TailwindCSS?

One of the few reasons why I think I got love struck with TailwindCSS is that I found out I can get the following out of the box:
- Easily Customizable
- Component-friendly
- CSS Framework

### Getting Started

To get started with TailwindCSS in your project you will need to install it as a dependency.

```
# using npm
npm install tailwindcss -save-dev or

# using yarn
yarn add tailwindcss --dev
```
