I was going through my twitter timeline last week and I stumbled on this tweet. And after checking out gridsome-starter-blog I decided to make the switch.

## Why I Made The Switch?
I was pretty comfortable with the design of the previous blog I had, I also like using Hugo this post is not to bash Hugo ðŸ˜„. I wanted flexibility and since I couldn't get that with my previous blog I decided to make the switch. I'm currently using the official [Gridsome Blog Starter](https://github.com/gridsome/gridsome-starter-blog), I just tweaked a few things and added a couple of features I require that was not in the starter.

In this post, I'll be highlighting how I made the switch and also add details of features I added to support my personal blog. Let's get started, shall we?

## Introducing Gridsome

![Gridsome](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_3D517D01AFC7E74C96BBEC559A051E8481EFE4E7CA50AF0EC2D3A5EA7519BF92_1548180739910_Screen+Shot+2019-01-22+at+7.11.51+PM.png)

[Gridsome](https://gridsome.org) is a Vue-powered static site generator for building blazing fast websites and Apps. Its a Vue alternative to Gatsby. I mostly like Gridsome because of its supports for GraphQL as a single source of truth for its data layer, allowing you connect to any headless CMS or external API like Google sheets, Airtable, local markdown files etc.  
When I was using Hugo it was stress-free I was able to find my way around the codebase with little knowledge of Go programming language because Hugo was built using Go. But I've found that its a bit tricky when I need to add extra features that are not present in the template I was making use of. So really It wasn't that flexible for me. I've been having an issue with syntax highlighting and when I tried to fix this recently it was a disaster. So before I moved I weighed down the pros and cons of moving will my readers still recognise my blog when they visit?  I did make the move anyway.

## Content Migration
Moving my content from Hugo to Gridsome was not that difficult because they are just markdown files and in Hugo I had my content in `content/post` and luckily enough Gridsome had the same directory. The only thing I had to do was format the frontmatter to fit Gridsome's format. One thing I really liked is the starter I'm currently using adopted [Dev.to](dev.to) frontmatter format and I'm a constant user of Dev so this was also easy for me to adopt.

## Customizing the Starter
This was really fun because the Gridsome team really made this a great starter. Some of the features supported already includes tags, dark/light toggle, beautiful and minimalistic UI and markdown support. These are the steps I took in installing and using this starter.

I created a new Gridsome project using these commands:

```
<!-- install gridsome globally -->
npm install --global @gridsome/cli

<!-- Then clone the starter repo -->
gridsome create gridsome-blog https://github.com/gridsome/gridsome-starter-blog.git

<!-- navigate to the directory -->
cd gridosme-blog

<!-- run the app on your local server -->
gridsome develop
```
There you have it! ðŸŽ‰ We've just created a Gridsome blog.


## Integrating Additional Features
I had to make some additional changes to this blog because a couple of integration I needed was not available. By default, you get gridsome/source-filesystem and gridsome/remark-prismjs. But I needed to add additional features like 
 - Google Analytics Support
 - Disqus for commenting
 - Newsletter
 - About Me Page
 - Share on Twitter functionality


 I've been able to add a few of these already. I was lucky to get Google analytics plugin already available so I only needed to install it. For Disqus I installed a package called `vue-disqus` and migrated the form I used for the newsletter over to this new blog only needed to tweak some styling so it fits this new layout.  This blog is still a work in progress as I add the other features I have pending. Overall so far moving to Gridsome has been great!

## Deploying
I used Netlify for hosting the previous blog and configured it to use a custom domain. I recently bought [giftegwuenu.dev](giftegwuenu.dev) and just make it redirect to [giftegwuenu.com](giftegwuenu.com). Switching from the previous blog to this was really quick because with Netlify you already have a domain assigned to any projects you create. So I deleted the custom domain from my previous blog and added it to this new one. And it worked pretty seamlessly. Netlify is Bae ðŸ’š

## Conclusion
Making this move wasn't as daunting as I thought it'll be. I'm happy I was able to do this and now I can play with Vue a framework I'm more familiar with as compared with when I was using Hugo and have to understand Go to make additional implementation changes. I'm now going to focus on creating content and don't worry I'm switching anytime soon.
