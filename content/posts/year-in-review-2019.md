The year is 2025, and I‚Äôm randomly scrolling through my blog and I come across this post I‚Äôve written, one thing is certain I‚Äôll have a sheepish smile on my face. The purpose of writing a year-end review is to reflect on how well you did, check yourself and set goals for the next year. [I started doing this in 2018](https://www.giftegwuenu.com/my-2018-year-in-review-and-2019-resolutions) and I know there‚Äôs value here and it helps reinforce the fact that I‚Äôm doing great and hitting my long term goals.

I resolved at the beginning of the year to create a list of things I wanted to achieve before the year runs out I used Notion for tracking my progress which I find helpful. I‚Äôm happy to say I accomplished all my goals for the year. Well, except a few like learning how to drive but I‚Äôve moved those to my 2020 goals.

## Highlights of the year ‚ú®

I tagged 2019 my year of grace because a lot of events that happened in my life didn‚Äôt go the way I had planned it they were even better than I expected. I am so sure God is looking out for me because I had a good year.

I spoke at [5 events](https://speakerdeck.com/lauragift21), one of which was a meetup in Denver my first ever international speaking opportunity and gave a Vue Vixens workshop at [Concatenate Conference.](http://concatenate.dev/)

I was super active in the community this year. This comes with a lot of hard work and opportunities. I helped organized 6 events (meetups and a conference). The Vue Vixens Nigeria chapter I help run had 3 events with over 150 women introduced to Vue.js. JAMstack Lagos a community I started with a friend [William Imoh](https://twitter.com/iChuloo) now has almost [600 members on Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/JAMStack-Lagos) with two events under our belts I look forward to doing more in 2020. I also helped co-organize one of the biggest conferences in Africa [Concatenate Conference](http://concatenate.dev/) with other amazing folks (Sarah, Simona, Christian, and Silm).

My dream to attend an international conference came to pass! Not only did I get a chance to attend one but I attended three different conferences. Microsoft Ignite, GitHub Universe and AWS re:Invent. This by far was one of the biggest events in my life this year and I‚Äôm grateful because not only did I attend I got to meet some of my heroes and made new connections not to forget the tons of knowledge gained on this adventure.

### **Life**   
My life was quite interesting nothing out of the blue. I was more intentional about self-care and looking out for myself. Also, like my friend will say trying to live my best life.


- I read about 3 books not proud of this because I wanted to do more but didn‚Äôt dedicate time to reach my set goal. I promise myself I‚Äôll do better by investing in audiobooks.
- I turned 24 and it feels like I‚Äôm getting old omg!!
- I traveled to 6 cities in 3 countries. This was such an amazing experience and I look forward to doing more trips in 2020.

- I decided to cut my hair. Best decision ever as I now feel free I never liked making my natural hair it was so painful.

## The L's in My Life 
I'll be lying to myself if I said the entire 2019 was great and only good things happened to me. Well, life they say is not always a bed of roses. I had different points in my life when I doubted myself and dealt with depression for most part of the year. Not even going to think about the amount of times I felt like an imposter. A shitty place to be in life is when you can't find happiness I was in this block for a period and I hated it. That didn't stop me from trying again when I fail because I won't give up if anything. I got rejected from getting things I was really hoping I would secure but regardless I kept the energy high and my attitude to those rejections was to keep trying I'm taking this same energy into 2020.

## Humans of 2019
I couldn't think of a better name for this section. I had grateful list in mind but decided to change it last minute. A special list of people who came through for me this year in one way or another and I want to thank them for taking a chance on me. These are people I now call friends and happy I have them in my life.

## What‚Äôs Next?  

I have a couple of things planned out for 2020. I also look forward to doing even more work and creating an impact than I did this year. It‚Äôs been such an exciting and scary journey I‚Äôve had and I sincerely look forward to what I do with myself in 2020. My mantra for 2020 is to Do The Work!! Some plans I‚Äôve in the works and hope to achieve include:

**More Speaking Engagements:** I hope to speak at more events in 2020 and also improve my skills as a speaker. 

**Keep the Fire Burning; Learn In Public:** I love the concept of [Learning in Public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/) and I want to be intentional about this in 2020. The act of learning in public means you get to share your skill development and your works in progress online, even before you think you‚Äôre ready. I want to continue sharing content on my blog, YouTube and help build communities. 

**Release Egghead Lessons:** I became an Egghead Instructor this year and I‚Äôm working on a couple of lessons and hoping they get released in 2020.

**Write a Book and release a Course:** I started working on this project this year but I look forward to releasing them in 2020.

**Land a New Job:** I want to explore more opportunities by 2020 that includes finding a new job. I‚Äôm open to working remotely or relocation. If you have any leads please let me know thanks!

That wraps up my year! It was a great one I can‚Äôt wait to see what I do in 2020 as it‚Äôs the start of a new decade I‚Äôm so excited to keep growing and making an impact in my community.
