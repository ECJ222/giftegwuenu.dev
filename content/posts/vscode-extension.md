_Code Editors are one of the essential tools for a Developer as long as you write code. But an interesting fact is every developer loves to enhance thier workflow and be more productive. I mean why waste time trying to achieve a task when there's a tool to do that. That brings us to the topic extensions for Vscode. These tools goes a long way in helping developers maintain thier codebase and also promote productivity. Ever since i switched to Vscode i've found the following extensions to be my holy grail. I pretty much can't do without them don't get me wrong i mean they're awesome tools to have around. Let's cut to the chase shall we._

**[PRETTIER:](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)** _is an awesome tool for keeping consistent codebase. It is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary._

**[ESLINT:](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-eslint)**  _i have a love-hate relationship with this tool because it's automated and i get to know what i'm doing wrong at a glance. The extension uses the ESLint library installed in the opened workspace folder. If the folder doesn't provide one the extension looks for a global install version. If you haven't installed ESLint either locally or globally do so by running `npm install eslint` in the workspace folder for a local install or `npm install -g eslint` for a global install._

**[GITLENS:](https://github.com/eamodio/vscode-gitlens)** _This extension is a powerful in ways you can't imagine. It has the ability to provide Git information (most recent commit, list of authors) in CodeLens, on-demand inline blame annotations, a blame explorer, and commands to compare changes with the working tree or previous versions._

**[VUE 2 SNIPPETS:](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.vue-vscode-snippets)**
_This extension will supercharge your Vue workflow. Easily scaffold Vue directives like v-for, v-if, v-show and more without running to the docs to confirm if you got the syntax right._

**[MARKDOWNLINT:](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint)** _Markdownlint is a Visual Studio Code extension that includes a library of rules to encourage standards and consistency for Markdown files. It is powered by markdownlint for Node.js which is based on markdownlint for Ruby._
