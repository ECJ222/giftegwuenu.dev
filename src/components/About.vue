      I’m passionate about making the web accessible to everyone and also an advocate for building open-source projects
      and I enjoy solving complex problems using web technologies. 
      I’m also a big advocate for building open and inclusive communities which led me to start the Vue Vixens chapter in Nigeria and the JAMstack community in Lagos. I'm a co-organizer of the Concatenate Conference, a Media Developer Expert at Cloudinary, and an Auth0 Ambassador. When I'm not coding you can find me geeking about photography and exploring different ways of documenting stories using photography and cooking delicious delicacies.
